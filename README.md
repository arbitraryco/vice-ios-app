Vice
=================
Repository for the [http://arbitrary.io](Arbitrary) + [http://superfriend.ly](SuperFriendly) iOS app. Full documentation on creation of the app can be found at [http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com](http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com)

This project is built on top of [http://openframworks.cc](openFrameworks), a creative coding toolkit. We go into our decision to use oF over Objective-C on our documentation (see link above). This repository was created first via a static download of openFrameworks 0.8.0 for iOS. We then removed all extraneous assets (e.g. project generator, example files) so later versions of openFrameworks don't impact the source here.

This will mean migrating to newer versions of oF may be painful, but we feel this is the least intrusive way to preserve the project at the time. (We reserve the right to change our minds!)
