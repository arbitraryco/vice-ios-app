Vice
=================
Repository for the [Arbitrary](http://arbitrary.io) + [SuperFriendly](http://superfriend.ly) iOS app. 

Overview
-----------------
Some time ago [Jamie](http://twitter.com/jkosoy) invented the idea of a simple diet for himself because he was worried about getting fat and unhealthy. But [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2Nb0T2pr-A](Jamie loves hamburgers) and didn't want to give up eating them. So he decided to restrict himself to a single burger a month. The results were outstanding: Jamie has kept his burger restriction for years now and tends to save that burger day for celebratory experiences. He's used the idea on other "vices" to a degree - fried foods, pork, etc.

Over time he began telling people about this and [Dan](http://twitter.com/danielmall) tried it for himself on soda. Again, it worked! Dan went from drinking soda 3x a day to once a month, happily.

Vice (terrible, tenative name) is about allowing people to set up their own allowances for things they want to restrict themselves on. You set the restriction- booze, drugs, food, hookers, whatever gets you - and then use the app to keep track of those moment when you allow yourself to give in.

We have no idea if people want or need this as an app. We think it's a good idea. We want to use it as a way to explore and invent together, and we're inviting the public to see how we go about creating this. 

Every meeting, wireframe, comp and prototype will be documented and put on the web. You'll see how we go about creating this app as it happens.

Technical Info
-----------------
This project is built on top of [openFrameworks](http://openframworks.cc), a creative coding toolkit. We go into our decision to use oF over Objective-C on our documentation (see link above). This repository was created first via a static download of openFrameworks 0.8.0 for iOS. We then removed all extraneous assets (e.g. project generator, example files) so later versions of openFrameworks don't impact the source here.

This will mean migrating to newer versions of oF may be painful, but we feel this is the least intrusive way to preserve the project at the time. (We reserve the right to change our minds!)
